#### Project 11: "Análise de Comportamento do Usuário - Startup de Produtos Alimentícios"

##### Description:
At a food product startup, the project involves analyzing user behavior within the company's app. The focus is on studying the sales funnel to understand how users progress to the purchase stage and where they drop off. Additionally, an A/A/B test compares old and new font designs, with two control groups using the old fonts and one test group using the new ones. The goal is to identify which font set yields better results and ensure the accuracy of the findings by comparing the control groups. The same dataset is used for both general analysis and the A/A/B test, similar to real-world scenarios.
